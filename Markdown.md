## What I've learned
Since I've worked with Git in a previous class, I did not learn much from the README and I have no confusions (except apparently I'm struggling on how to get this thing to let me do a pull request, woops). <sub>I'll probably forget things, however.</sub>

**Wow, <sup>superscript</sup>**
