## What I've learned
Since I've worked with Git in a previous class, I did not learn much from the README and I have no confusions. I'll probably forget things, however.

## Course Opinion
Not sure if I'm supposed to do this part, but the course they provide about Git is helpful. I think it covers everything I would cover, so there is nothing else I would to see out of it.
