### Profile README

**I am Alex Gass.** I am interested in continuing my knowledge of programming and expanding it as much as I can, but I have amassed interests in creative writing and pixel art as well that I have put time into.
  
  Currently, I'm taking a break from a game I'm helping make to participate in a character creation contest for a game I play. I'm also writing a fiction novel, but that is coming along very slowly and I don't have the time to fully commit to it right now amidst my responsibilities and other hobbies.

  My main hobby has been game design, and I've dabbled in streaming as a potential hobby _(still unsure)_.
